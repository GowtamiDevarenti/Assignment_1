# #1. What is the role of try and exception block?
# ans:The try-except block, also known as the try-catch block in some programming languages, is used for exception handling in various programming languages. It allows you to handle and recover from errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program.
# 
# The role of a try-except block is to enclose a section of code that is potentially prone to throwing an exception. The structure of a try-except block typically follows this pattern:

# In[ ]:


try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception


# Here's how it works:
# 
# The code within the try block is executed. If an exception occurs within this block, it interrupts the normal flow of execution.
# Once an exception is raised, the program looks for an except block that can handle that specific type of exception.
# If an appropriate except block is found, the code within that block is executed to handle the exception.
# After executing the except block, the program continues with the remaining code after the try-except block.
# If no suitable except block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack, potentially causing the program to terminate or triggering some other form of exception handling mechanism defined elsewhere in the program.
# By using try-except blocks, you can gracefully handle exceptions, provide meaningful error messages, and take alternative actions to recover from errors, rather than abruptly terminating the program. It helps in improving the robustness and reliability of your code.

# #2. What is the syntax for a basic try-except block?
# ans:The basic syntax for a try-except block varies slightly depending on the programming language you are using. However, I'll provide examples in a few commonly used languages:

# In[ ]:


#python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception


# In[ ]:


#Java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType exceptionVariable) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}


# In[ ]:


#c++
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType exceptionVariable) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}


# #3. What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching
# except block?
# ans:If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle that specific type of exception, the exception will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by an appropriate exception handler.
# 
# In such a case, the program's normal flow of execution is interrupted, and it begins to unwind the call stack, searching for an exception handler that can handle the exception. If no suitable exception handler is found, the program may terminate abruptly, and an error message or stack trace will be displayed, indicating the unhandled exception.
# 
# The exact behavior can vary depending on the programming language and the runtime environment. In some languages, an unhandled exception may cause the program to terminate immediately. In others, the runtime environment or operating system may provide default exception handling mechanisms, such as printing an error message or generating a core dump.
# 
# To ensure proper exception handling and prevent unhandled exceptions from terminating the program, it is generally recommended to have a catch block that handles the most common and expected exceptions, and to include a more general catch block at the end to handle any unexpected or unhandled exceptions. This approach helps in providing graceful error handling and preventing crashes or unexpected termination of the program.

# #4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific
# exception type?
# ans:When handling exceptions using try-except blocks, there is a difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type. Let's examine the distinctions:
# 
# Specific Exception Type:
# 
# When you specify a specific exception type in the except block (e.g., except ValueError:), it means that the corresponding except block will only handle exceptions of that particular type or its subclasses. It provides targeted exception handling for a specific type of error.
# Using specific exception types allows you to provide specialized handling logic for different types of exceptions. You can customize the error recovery or response based on the specific exception that occurred.
# It is considered good practice to handle exceptions selectively by specifying the relevant exception types rather than catching all exceptions.
# Bare Except Block:
# 
# A bare except block (e.g., except: without specifying an exception type) will catch and handle any exception, regardless of its type. It acts as a catch-all for any exception that occurs within the corresponding try block.
# Using a bare except block can be convenient in certain scenarios, as it prevents the program from abruptly terminating when an unexpected exception occurs.
# However, using a bare except block without any specific exception type can also lead to potential issues. It makes it harder to identify and debug specific exceptions, as all exceptions are caught and handled uniformly. It can mask errors and make it difficult to diagnose the root cause of an exception.
# In general, it is recommended to use specific exception types in the except blocks whenever possible. This allows for more precise and targeted exception handling, improves code readability, and helps in diagnosing and resolving issues more effectively. The use of bare except blocks should be avoided or used sparingly, as they can make it harder to identify and handle exceptions properly.

# #5. Can you have nested try-except blocks in Python? If yes, then give an example.
# ans:Yes, it is possible to have nested try-except blocks in Python. This means that you can have a try block inside another try block, and each try block can have its own corresponding except block. This allows for handling exceptions at different levels of code execution. Here's an example to illustrate nested try-except blocks in Python:

# In[5]:


try:
    # Outer try block
    print("Outer try block")
    try:
        # Inner try block
        print("Inner try block")
        a = 10
        b = 0
        result = a / b  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
        print("Result:", result)  # This line will not be executed
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Inner except block
        print("Caught ZeroDivisionError in inner except block")
    finally:
        # Inner finally block
        print("Inner finally block")
except:
    # Outer except block
    print("Caught exception in outer except block")
finally:
    # Outer finally block
    print("Outer finally block")


# As you can see, the program flow jumps from the inner try block to the corresponding inner except block upon encountering the ZeroDivisionError. After executing the inner finally block, the flow continues to the outer finally block. If there were no matching except blocks for the encountered exception, the flow would have propagated to the outer except block, and then the finally blocks would have been executed.

# #6. Can we use multiple exception blocks, if yes then give an example.
# ans:Yes, it is possible to use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions in Python. This allows you to provide different handling mechanisms based on the specific exception that occurs. Here's an example to illustrate the use of multiple exception blocks:

# In[6]:


try:
    a = 10
    b = 0
    result = a / b  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
    print("Result:", result)  # This line will not be executed
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Caught ZeroDivisionError")
except ValueError:
    print("Caught ValueError")
except:
    print("Caught an exception")


# In this example, there are three except blocks following the try block. The first except block specifically handles the ZeroDivisionError, the second except block handles the ValueError, and the third except block serves as a catch-all for any other exceptions.
# 
# If a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the program will jump to the first except block and execute its code. Similarly, if a ValueError occurs, the program will jump to the second except block. If any other exception occurs that is not explicitly handled by the first two except blocks, the program will jump to the third except block.
# 
# It's important to note that the order of the except blocks matters. Python matches the exception against the except blocks in the order they are defined. Therefore, if a more specific exception type is defined after a more general one, the more specific exception block will never be reached because the more general one will catch the exception first.
# 
# Using multiple except blocks allows you to handle different exceptions separately, providing more granular error handling and improving the robustness of your code.

# #7. Write the reason due to which following errors are raised:
# a. EOFError
# b. FloatingPointError
# c. IndexError
# d. MemoryError
# e. OverflowError
# f. TabError
# g. ValueError
# ans:Here are the reasons due to which the following errors are raised:
# 
# a. EOFError:
# 
# An EOFError (End of File Error) is raised when an input operation reaches the end of a file or input stream unexpectedly.
# This error typically occurs when a program tries to read input beyond the end of a file or when the input stream is closed.
# b. FloatingPointError:
# 
# A FloatingPointError is raised when a floating-point operation encounters an exceptional condition that cannot be handled.
# This error can occur due to various reasons, such as dividing a number by zero, performing an invalid mathematical operation, or encountering an overflow or underflow condition.
# c. IndexError:
# 
# An IndexError is raised when a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) is indexed with an invalid index or when trying to access an element that is out of range.
# This error typically occurs when an index is negative or exceeds the size of the sequence.
# d. MemoryError:
# 
# A MemoryError is raised when an operation fails to allocate enough memory to complete its task.
# This error occurs when the program tries to allocate more memory than the system can provide or when the available memory is exhausted.
# e. OverflowError:
# 
# An OverflowError is raised when the result of a numeric operation exceeds the range of representable values for the data type being used.
# This error typically occurs when performing arithmetic operations on numbers that are too large to be represented within the available numeric data type.
# f. TabError:
# 
# A TabError is raised when there are inconsistencies or issues with the use of tabs and spaces for indentation in Python code.
# This error occurs when the indentation in a block of code is not consistent or when a mix of tabs and spaces is used for indentation, causing conflicts in the code's structure.
# g. ValueError:
# 
# A ValueError is raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an invalid value or when a conversion between data types fails.
# This error can occur when trying to convert a string to a numeric type but the string does not represent a valid number or when an argument is provided with an unexpected or inappropriate value.
# Understanding the reasons behind these errors can help in diagnosing and resolving issues in your code and handling the exceptions appropriately.

# #8. Write code for the following given scenario and add try-exception block to it.
# a. Program to divide two numbers
# b. Program to convert a string to an integer
# c. Program to access an element in a list
# d. Program to handle a specific exception
# e. Program to handle any exception

# In[ ]:


#a. Program to divide two numbers:
try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    result = numerator / denominator
    print("Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter valid integers.")


# In[ ]:


#b. Program to convert a string to an integer:
try:
    num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = int(num_str)
    print("Number:", num)
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")


# In[ ]:


#c. Program to access an element in a list:
try:
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    index = int(input("Enter the index: "))
    value = my_list[index]
    print("Value at index", index, "is:", value)
except IndexError:
    print("Error: Index out of range.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid index.")


# In[ ]:


#d. Program to handle a specific exception:
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print("Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")



# In[ ]:


#e. Program to handle any exception:
try:
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    result = num1 / num2
    print("Result:", result)
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))


# In the last example, the except block catches any exception using the generic Exception class. The 'as e' part captures the exception object for further analysis or printing its details. However, it is generally recommended to handle specific exceptions whenever possible instead of catching all exceptions with a generic except block.
